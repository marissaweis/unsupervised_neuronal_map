# An unsupervised map of excitatory neuronsâ€™ dendritic morphology in the mouse visual cortex

This repository contains code for the paper [An unsupervised map of excitatory neuron dendritic morphology in the mouse visual cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58763-w).

## Preprocessed data and meta data
Data is published under "Source data" with the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58763-w#Sec40). This includes the learned morphological embeddings of the MICrONS neurons as well as morphometrics computed on them.


## Downloading the raw data
The raw data can be found in the [MICrONS Explorer](https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3).

Graphs of the neurons were extracted using [NEURD](https://github.com/reimerlab/NEURD).


## Training *GraphDINO*
[Code](https://eckerlab.org/code/weis2023/) and [publication](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ThhMzfrd6r) on how to train *GraphDINO* can be found here.

The checkpoint for the pre-trained GraphDINO on the [MICrONS data](https://www.microns-explorer.org/) as well as the configuration file can be found here: 
- [ckpt_microns.pt](https://github.com/marissaweis/unsupervised_neuronal_map/blob/main/data/graphdino/ckpts/ckpt_microns.pt)
- [config.json](https://github.com/marissaweis/unsupervised_neuronal_map/blob/main/data/graphdino/ckpts/config.json)

The learned morphological embeddings of the MICrONS data can be found under "Source data" with the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58763-w#Sec40).


## Analyses

<!--Necessary inputs to the evaluation pipeline are explained [here](https://github.com/marissaweis/unsupervised_neuronal_map/blob/main/data/).-->

Reproduction of the analyses and figures of the paper:
1. [Preprocessing](https://github.com/marissaweis/unsupervised_neuronal_map/blob/main/evaluation_pipeline/preprocessing/): Notebooks to perform volume rotation and normalization as well as some quality control of the used neurons.
2. [Classifiers](https://github.com/marissaweis/unsupervised_neuronal_map/blob/main/evaluation_pipeline/classifiers/): Notebooks and scripts to train supervised classifiers on the labeled subset of the MICrONS data and to apply them to the whole volume.
3. [Clustering](https://github.com/marissaweis/unsupervised_neuronal_map/blob/main/evaluation_pipeline/clustering/): Scripts to fit Gaussian mixture models to data.
4. [Cluster versus continuum analysis](https://github.com/marissaweis/cluster_vs_continuum): Scripts and notebooks to generate synthetic data and run our cluster versus contiuum analysis can be found in separate repository.
4. [Quality control](https://github.com/marissaweis/unsupervised_neuronal_map/blob/main/evaluation_pipeline/quality_control/): Notebooks to exclude fragmented neurons before further analysis.
5. [Visualizations](https://github.com/marissaweis/unsupervised_neuronal_map/blob/main/evaluation_pipeline/visualizations/): Notebooks to plot figures of the paper.
6. [Basal bias prediction](https://github.com/marissaweis/unsupervised_neuronal_map/blob/main/evaluation_pipeline/basal_bias_prediction/): Prediction of basal bias from functional embeddings of L4 neurons. Functional embeddings are taken from [Towards a Foundation Model of the Mouse Visual Cortex](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.21.533548v2).


## Differences to paper
We have simplified the computation of the layer boundaries which leads to slightly different layer boundaris than those used in the paper. Exclusion of layer 4 and layer 6 neurons was done using earlier version of the layer boundaries. <!--These can be found [here]().-->
